            I created a web page that listed my favorite movies. This was one of

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Although my background is in accounting and business, my real passion is
        for the arts. I love music, paintings, movies, and stories. In fact, my
        first degree was in English Literature because I loved stories so much.
        I'm trying to find time to write my own stories. I also want to write my
        own reviews and essays about media and entertainment. I'm learning web
        development to accomplish this goal. I would like to make my own website
        that talks about and reviews all sorts of media.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also love photography. I liked to take pictures on my phone but I was
        never satisfied with the fidelity and quality of mobile devices. I
        bought my first camera while working my first job and I fell in love
        with photography soon after.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love video games, too! In fact, I aspire to become a game developer
        some day. Just making something small, even if it's a small platforming
        game like the original Mario, would make me happy. Plus, I'd be able to
        put my interests in art, music, and programming together into one single
        project, which seems pretty cool to me!
